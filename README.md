# 🧱 My ZenChain & ZyNFT Projects Portfolio

Hey there! 👋  
I’m a passionate Web3 learner and builder, currently diving deep into the ZenChain ecosystem and actively working with ZyNFT — a zero-gas NFT marketplace.

My goal is to explore real-world use cases for NFTs, create intuitive dApps, and contribute to ZenChain’s mission of decentralized interoperability.
